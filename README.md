#Structural Column Solver
Simple C++ program that can calculate the data related to mechanical engineering column design.

Columns are vertical structural elements that primarily withstand compressive forces. Understanding the behavior of columns under different loading conditions is a critical aspect of structural engineering, especially in the design of buildings, bridges, towers, and other structures.
